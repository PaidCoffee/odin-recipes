    <p>Pancakes are soft, fluffy rounds of cooked batter, typically made from a mixture of flour,
         eggs, milk, baking powder, and a touch of sugar. 
         Golden-brown on the outside and tender on the inside, 
         they're often stacked high and served warm with a drizzle of syrup melting down the sides. 
         Their surface is slightly crisp at the edges, while the center stays light and airy.</p>

    <p>Whether topped with butter, fresh berries, whipped cream, or chocolate chips, 
        pancakes are a comforting and versatile dish â€” 
        perfect for slow weekend mornings or cozy breakfast-for-dinner nights. 
        Each bite offers a gentle sweetness and a pillowy texture that feels like a hug for your taste buds.</p>
